# Gradient-Descent-and-PyTorch
Using networks to recognize handwritten Hiragana symbols. The dataset to be used is Kuzushiji-MNIST or KMNIST for short. 

All the input mapped directly to 10 ReLU activated nodes. The program will train three models, a Linear
Network, Feed Forward network, and a Convolutional Network, for 10 epochs each.
